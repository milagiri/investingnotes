- The market is supposed to be efficient, so the best advice for the vast majority of people is to index
- But it is possible to beat the market and generate outsize returns. When you ask people in a group to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar (in secret), the average turns out to be pretty close to the right number. But when you went around the room and asked each person to state their guess in turn aloud, the average is way off. The stock market behaves kind of like the second scenario because each person's guess is influenced by other people's guesses.

- Stock prices fluctuate all around the fair value. You have the opportunity to buy when the price is below the line (undervalued), and short when it is above the line

- How you value stocks -- 
	- comparables - how relatively cheap is this business relative to other businesses, also how has the business value changed over time. Relative cheapness is not enough if there's a bubble
	- discounted cash flow -- how much cash flow will you get from the business

- Find the stocks that are most undervalued relative to their peers, buy them and hold them. The reason everyone doesn't do this is that it's hard to hold when the market is fluctuating.
